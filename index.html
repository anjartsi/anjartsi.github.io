			<h2>
				Origin Story
			</h2>
			<p>
				Around my Junior year at UCLA I finally got around to taking a computer science class, and I immediately fell in love with it. Ever since then I've been thinking about things in terms of coding.
			</p>
			<p>
				More often than not I'd be satisfied with just <i>thinking</i> about things, but sometimes I felt that I had to get my hands dirty and actually write something. One bit of code I was particularly proud of would test whether my "Roll Some Dice" function was mimicking fair dice (it wasn't).
			</p>
			<p>
				The biggest issue I had was lack of a platform to share my creations with the world. I was mostly coding in C++ and LabView at the time, and I didn't see a very easy (or interesting) way to share what I wrote: C++ is mostly text-based and LabView requires a license to allow you to create executables. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Late 2013 I learned HTML/CSS and JavaScript on 
				<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/armen321">Codecademy</a>
				, and began coding almost exclusively in JS. I fell in love with this platform, and saw potential in its ability to share content easily/painlessly. Soon enough I decided to make this content available for all the world to see (it felt wrong to deprive the world of my art), so I purchased a domain name and here we are.

				There's not much to say about this page, it's more or less the Home page, but click through to some of the other pages, those are a lot more interesting than this one. (I may be using the word "interesting" too liberally here)
